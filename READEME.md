# RLP Encoder
A 0-depnedency simple RLP encoder that _only_ encodes `Uint8Array`s and arrays of them (including nested).  It is up to the user to appropriately convert their numbers, bigints, strings, etc. into `Uint8Array`s since the RLP specification does not prescribe how such things are encoded prior to being RLP encoded.

## Usage
```
npm install @zoltu/rlp-encoder
```
```typescript
const input = [
	[new Uint8Array([0x6b, 0x65, 0x79, 0x31]), new Uint8Array([0x76, 0x61, 0x6c, 0x31])],
	[new Uint8Array([0x6b, 0x65, 0x79, 0x32]), new Uint8Array([0x76, 0x61, 0x6c, 0x32])],
	[new Uint8Array([0x6b, 0x65, 0x79, 0x33]), new Uint8Array([0x76, 0x61, 0x6c, 0x33])],
	[new Uint8Array([0x6b, 0x65, 0x79, 0x34]), new Uint8Array([0x76, 0x61, 0x6c, 0x34])],
]
const actual = rlpEncode(input) // [0xec, 0xca, 0x84, 0x6b, 0x65, 0x79, 0x31, 0x84, 0x76, 0x61, 0x6c, 0x31, 0xca, 0x84, 0x6b, 0x65, 0x79, 0x32, 0x84, 0x76, 0x61, 0x6c, 0x32, 0xca, 0x84, 0x6b, 0x65, 0x79, 0x33, 0x84, 0x76, 0x61, 0x6c, 0x33, 0xca, 0x84, 0x6b, 0x65, 0x79, 0x34, 0x84, 0x76, 0x61, 0x6c, 0x34] as Uint8Array
```
